1.) Building an out-of-source plugin with cmake:

You need to have the wireshark headers installed.

To build with cmake (in a separate build/ directory):
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ..
  make
  make install

This will build the .so plugin for wireshark and install it into the user's 
~/.wireshark/plugins/ directory, where wireshark will load plugins from.




2.) Building an in-source plugin

It is also possible to build the plugin within the wireshark sources.

You need to get the wireshark sources, and then move this plugin to the plugin folder.
For more information on how to compile see the Wireshark docs(wireshark/docs/README.plugins) and the Custom example files
